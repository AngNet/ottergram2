In this assignment, you will work through Chapter 6 of the textbook to add JavaScript to Ottergram.
In order to complete this assignment, you will need to have worked through Steps 6-8 of Homework 0.

Complete the following:
1. Work through Chapter 6. As you make changes to main.js, verify that you see error messages reported by ESLint (for example, try leaving off a semicolon).
2. Confirm that clicking each thumbnail changes the detail image and title to match.
3. Add previous and next buttons on either side of the detail image, labeled with < and >. Use the buttons to cycle back and forth through thumbnails and corresponding detail images and titles.
